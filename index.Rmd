# This is Karina's (shitty) website

What I think I look like when I code... 

What I actually look [like](about.html)


## Basics 

### Hyperlinking
[This is my sad class website](https://p8105.com/making_websites.html)

### more than one page 
[linking more than one page!](about.html)

### Adding Pictures
<img src="image/trouble.jpg" style="width:75%">

Note
 - style component is adding border, adjusting height, etc 
 - If you want your style rules to apply to all images, you can write a CSS file 


## BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE
[index](sad.html)


## more notes (_site.yml)

Right now, all our pages have styling, output, and structure coming from page-specific YAML. It's better to have one set of rules that apply site wide. To do this, we'll create a single file with all the YAML stuff we need, and at the same remove extraneous YAML header content from individual Rmd files 

Our _site.yml file had information about output options and the navbar.

R Project 
```{r}
#rmarkdown::render_site()
```
This rebuilds the full website, whereas knit only rebuilds a page.
