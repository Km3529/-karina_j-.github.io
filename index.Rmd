## Common Content

### Hyperlinking
[this](https://p8105.com/making_websites.html)

### more than one page 
[about](about.html)

### Adding Pictures
<img src="image/image.jpg" style="width:75%">

Notes: style component is addign border, adjusting height, etc 

If you want your style rules to apply to all images, you can write a CSS file 

## _site.yml

Right now, all our pages have styling, output, and structure coming from page-specific YAML. It's better to have one set of rules that apply site wide. To do this, we'll create a single file with all the YAML stuff we need, and at the same remove extraneous YAML header content from individual Rmd files 

Our _site.yml file had information about output options and the navbar.

R Project 
```{r}
#rmarkdown::render_site()
```
This rebuilds the full website, whereas knit only rebuilds a page.
